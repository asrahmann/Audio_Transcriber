# Audio Transcriber

## Overview

Audio Transcriber is a simple web application that allows users to upload audio files and receive a transcription of the spoken content using OpenAI's Whisper model. It consists of two parts:

- **Frontend:** A responsive HTML/JavaScript user interface built with Tailwind CSS that lets users select audio files and view transcriptions.
- **Backend:** A Python Flask server running the Whisper model to process audio files and return transcriptions via a REST API.

This project demonstrates how to connect a modern web frontend to a powerful speech-to-text model running on a backend server.

## Features

- Upload audio files in formats such as MP3, WAV, M4A, and more.
- See progress and loading indicators while transcription is running.
- Get accurate transcriptions generated by Whisperâ€™s base model running on CPU.
- Copy transcription text to clipboard easily.
- Simple, clean UI with feedback messages for success and error states.
- Cross-origin requests enabled for frontend-backend communication during development.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- `whisper` Python package (OpenAI Whisper)
- Flask web framework
- Flask-CORS for handling cross-origin requests
- A modern web browser for the frontend UI
- Internet access during the first model download (Whisper model downloads once)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-transcriber.git
   cd audio-transcriber

## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
- .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

## Install required Python packages
 - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Flask backend server
 - python app.py
 - The backend will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000 (or http://127.0.0.1:5000)

 ## Open the index.html file in your web browser
 - You can open the frontend directly by double-clicking the HTML file or serve it via a local HTTP server for best results.

 ## Usage

- On the frontend page, click the file input to select an audio file.
- Click the **Transcribe Audio** button to start the transcription process.
- Wait for the processing spinner to finish.
- View the transcription result displayed below.
- Use the **Copy Transcription** button to copy the text to your clipboard.

## How It Works

- The frontend collects an audio file and sends it to the backend using a POST request with form data.
- The backend receives the audio file, saves it temporarily, and passes it to the Whisper model for transcription.
- The transcription result is sent back as JSON to the frontend.
- The frontend updates the UI with the transcription or shows an error message if something went wrong.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model loading issues:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection on first run as the Whisper model downloads.
- **CORS errors:** Make sure Flask-CORS is enabled to allow frontend requests if running frontend and backend separately.
- **File upload errors:** Check the accepted audio file formats and file size.
- **Permission errors:** Run commands with appropriate permissions, especially on Windows.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more audio formats.
- Add language selection for transcription.
- Add authentication and user management.
- Deploy the backend to a cloud server.
- Improve UI/UX with more feedback and progress bars.
